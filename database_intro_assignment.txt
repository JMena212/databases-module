1. What data types do each of these values represent?

"A Clockwork Orange"  is a string.
42 is an integer value
09/02/1945 is a DATE
98.7 is a FLOAT
$15.99  is a MONEY data type in SQL


2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used.
Explain when a text file might be used.

A database is required any time that multiple applications are accessing
or manipulating data. Databases files store data in a manner that allows
for quick retrieval/creation/removal/updates of data. This is critical when dealing
with large amounts of data.

Text files are human readable and are ideal file types when we don't expect the data
displayed to change very often.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

One difference between SQL and other programming languages like Ruby, for example,
is that it SQL is a declarative language versus a procedural/object oriented language.
In SQL, we make a request to a database. In a procedural language, we lay out the steps
(algorithms) needed to produce an intended result.

4 & 5.  In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
xplain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.



In a database system, data is laid out in tables with columns and rows. Values are stored in cells
within those tables. Each single column will house one category or label or data type. Rows
provide an entire set of values across various columns. If the database had measurables for humans, for example,
a column might be "HEIGHT" or "WEIGHT". A row would have all the values across all columns: name, height, weight, age, etc.


6. Three data types that can be used in a table are float, string, date.


7. SELECT date, amount
   FROM payments;
   *This query will return all the dates (value) and amounts (value) of all payments listed. Dates and amounts are columns. Payments is the table. *

   SELECT amount
    FROM payments
    WHERE amount > 500;
    *This query will only return the payment amounts of payments that are greater than 500*

    SELECT *
    FROM payments
    WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';
    *The 'SELECT *' operator means that we will retrieve the entire row where the column payee = 'Mega Foods'.*


8.  QUERIES

The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.
SELECT email, sign-up date
FROM users
WHERE name = "DeAndre Data"


The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.
SELECT userid
FROM users
WHERE email = 'aleesia@algorithm@uw.edu'


All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.
 SELECT *
 FROM users
 where userid = 4
